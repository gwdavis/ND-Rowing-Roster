DESCRIPTION OF THE APP

###Requirements:
* Python
* postgresql
* psql 9.3.6

For the Udacity Nano-Degree class, we installed a virtual machine using VirtualBox and Vagrant and pulled the necessary setup from GIT (see: https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant)

###Files:

###Installation (on a Mac OS)
* Open Terminal on the Mac (it is found in the utilities folder or use Spotlight to search for it)
* Change the directory from home to the vagrant directory installed on the Mac.  This can be done with:
```ShellSession
> cd [path to get to:]fullstack/vagrant  
```
* Fire up the virtual machine: 
```ShellSession 
> vagrant up
```  
* SSH into the virtual machine, again form the Mac Terminal program: 
```ShellSession 
> vagrant SSH  
```
  You should now see the command line of the virtual machine


###Running the program

* From the command line of the virtual machine, change directory to that of the tournament files:
```ShellSession
> cd /vagrant/FOLDER
```

```
